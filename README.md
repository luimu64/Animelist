Super simple animelist made with PHP and MySQL

You need to have a MySQL/mariadb server with the structure of database/animelist.sql. 
You also need to rename the database/connection-template.php to be connection.php and change it's contents to reflect your database connection details.
Then just dump the folder in your preferred folder where you have configured apache to run the site from.
I used PHPMyAdmin to add entries but can use any tool able to add database entries.
